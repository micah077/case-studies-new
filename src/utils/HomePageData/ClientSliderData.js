      "I needed a strong digital footprint for my business, so I researched and came across Strugbits. After a few calls and meetings, my confidence in them was greater than with others. They built my website, provided alternative ideas, and delivered a great site they still manage. Customer service is great, timely, and fairly priced. They're a joy to do business with.",

      "My experience with Strugbits has been absolutely amazing. I reached out to them as I needed my website to be reconstructed and refurbished. I made a quick website from scratch just to function my business and make sales, but it wasn’t up to professional standards. They came in and completely made a new plan. They supported me through this journey, gave me ideas, and were constantly in contact. I’m very grateful to be in touch with them and highly recommend their service. They’re absolutely amazing, very patient, and just lovely overall.",

      "As an entrepreneur with a new company, I needed a developer to help me work smarter, not harder. Strugbits exceeded my expectations. Other agencies said my requests were impossible, but Strugbits thought outside the box and delivered a fantastic solution. Their team was responsive, patient, and professional, explaining everything clearly for my non-tech brain. With affordable pricing and highly skilled developers, they are a five-star company. I choose Strugbits as a trusted tech partner and I look forward to their guidance in any future projects I may have.",
